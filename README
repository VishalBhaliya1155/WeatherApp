This React Weather App is a simple, responsive, and user-friendly web application designed to provide users with current weather information, hourly forecasts, and a weekly weather outlook. Built using React.js and styled with custom CSS, this application offers a clean interface and smooth user experience across all devices. It uses data from the OpenWeatherMap API and does not include any map-based visualizations, which keeps the app lightweight and fast.

Upon loading, the application automatically fetches and displays the weather for the default city, which is set to Vadodara. Users can search for other cities using the search bar located prominently at the top. The search functionality is built using controlled components in React, and the city input is passed to API requests for both current weather and forecast data.

The weather information is displayed in a structured layout that consists of a left and right column. The left section shows the current weather details including city name, date, temperature, weather condition, and a weather icon. Below this, a detailed air condition section is presented which includes real feel temperature, wind speed, cloud percentage, and humidity. These values are displayed in a two-column flexible grid for clarity and compactness.

The application also provides a horizontal scroll view showing todayâ€™s forecast broken down by hour. Each forecast item displays the time, temperature, and condition, allowing users to quickly understand how the weather will change throughout the day.

On the right side of the layout, a weekly forecast is displayed. This section shows five days of future weather data, including daily temperature and general weather descriptions. The forecast is arranged in a responsive grid layout, which automatically adjusts for smaller screen sizes.

To improve the user experience, the application includes support for dark and light mode. The user can toggle between the two themes using a button in the top left corner. This mode switch is handled using React state and updates the CSS variables used throughout the app, allowing for a seamless transition between color themes.
