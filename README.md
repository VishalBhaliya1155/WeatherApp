 Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to set up and run the project locally:

1 Clone the Repository

```bash
 if using git 
 Option 1: Clone the Repository (Recommended)
git clone https://github.com/VishalBhaliya1155/WeatherApp.git

cd WeatherApp
else
Option 2: Download ZIP (If You Don't Want to Use Git)
Go to the GitHub repo: https://github.com/VishalBhaliya1155/WeatherApp

Click the green Code button and select Download ZIP

Extract the ZIP file

Open the folder in your code editor (e.g., VS Code)

Open the terminal inside that folder


2. Install Dependencies
npm install

 Note: Steps 3 and 4 are optional. You can skip them because the project already includes a working OpenWeatherMap API key for testing. However, if you want to use your own API key, follow steps 3 and 4.
      3.Get API Key from OpenWeatherMap
      Go to https://openweathermap.org/api

      4. in .env file
      REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY=  if need change key 
  
 5. Run the Project
 npm start

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
